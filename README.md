## Prenatal Exposure to SARS and Birth Weight: Exploiting a Natural Experiment in Hong Kong

#### Research Statement 

- By exploiting SARS as an exogenous source of stress, this paper examines whether prenatal maternal exposure to such stress affects birth weight with the applicatin of OLS/ANOVA, Propensity Score Matching, and Bootstrapping.

#### Outline

- Introduction
- Background
  - SARS as a Public Health Crisis
  - Maternal Stress as Mechanisms
  - SARS as Exogenous Sources of Maternal Stress
- Literature Review
- Methods
  - Data
  - Variables
  - Models
    - SARS as an Experiment (randomized)
      - OLS/ANOVA
    - SARS as a Quasi-Experiment (non-randomized)
      - Propensity Score Matching
      - OLS/ANOVA
      - Bootstrapping
- Results
  - $Y_i = \alpha + \beta\space Treat + e_i$ where $\beta = E(Y_i^{Treatment} - Y_i^{Control})$ is the Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
